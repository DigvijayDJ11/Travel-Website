        <h3>Uttar Predesh</h3>
        <p><strong>The Ram Mandir is a Hindu temple under construction in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India. It is located at the site of Ram Janmabhoomi, the hypothesized birthplace of Rama, a principal deity of Hinduism
            The site is the former location of the Babri Masjid which was built in 16th century CE after the demolition of an existing non-Islamic structure. The idols of Rama and Sita were placed in the mosque in 1949, before it was attacked and demolished in 1992
            the Supreme Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for construction of a temple, while Muslims would be given land elsewhere to construct a mosque</strong></p>

                Mughal emperor Humayun was crowned at this fort. It was later renovated by the Mughal emperor Akbar from 1565 and the present-day structure was completed in 1573. It served as the main residence of the rulers of the Mughal dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. It was also known as the "Lal-Qila" or "Qila-i-Akbari". Before being captured by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its importance during the Mughal Dynasty. It is about 2.5 kilometers (1.6 mi) northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city.
                 It was later renovated by Shah Jahan.  for more details <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agra_Fort">click here</a>
