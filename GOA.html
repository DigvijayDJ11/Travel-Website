        <h3>GOA</h3>
        <p><strong>Goa , State, southwestern India. Area: 1,429 sq mi (3,702 sq km). Population: (2011) 1,457,723. Capital: Panaji. Located on India’s western coast, it is bordered by Maharashtra and Karnataka states. It has a 65-mi (105-km) coastline on the Arabian Sea and includes the offshore island of Goa. It was ruled by Hindu dynasties and Muslim sultanates until the late 15th century and came under Portuguese control in 1510. 
            Their settlement of Old Goa became the capital of Portuguese India. After India attained independence in 1947, it demanded that Portugal cede Goa. Indian troops finally occupied Goa in 1961; it was subsequently incorporated into India as part of the territory of Goa, Daman, and Diu. It became a state in 1987, with Daman and Diu remaining as a union territory. Goa is predominantly agricultural; its distinctive architecture and fine beaches also make it a popular tourist destination.</strong></p>

        <div class="box" data-aos="zoom-in">
            <img src="image/fort aguda.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Fort Aguda</h3>
            <span class="desc">Fort Aguada is a 17th-century Portuguese fort looking out at the confluence of Mandovi River and the Arabian Sea. The crumbling ramparts of the fort stand on the Sinquerim Beach, approximately 18 km from Panjim. The highlight of the fort is a lone four-storey lighthouse (which is one-of-its-kind in Asia )and a stunning view of the sunset.

                Built-in 1612 as a protection from Dutch and Marathas, Fort Aguada was the most prized and crucial fort for the Portuguese and covers the entire peninsula at the southwestern tip of Bardez. The fort is so named after the Portuguese Word for water i.e. 'Agua' and used to be a replenishing source of freshwater for sailors. In fact, it has the capacity to hold 2,376,000 gallons of water and was one of the biggest freshwater reservoirs of Asia.
                
                Fort Aguada has also been used as Aguada jail. A statue in front of the jail salutes the freedom fighters, giving the fort a touch of patriotism.</span>

            <h3>Calangute Beaches</h3>
            <span class="desc">"The Queen of Beaches"
                Calangute Beach
                Situated 15 km from Panjim, Calangute Beach is the longest beach in North Goa, stretching from Candolim to Baga. Due to its sheer size and popularity, it is a hub for tourists and backpackers from all over the world.
                
                Popular as the "Queen of Beaches", the Calangute Beach of Goa is among the top ten bathing beaches in the world. Being one of the busiest and most commercial beaches of Goa, it is swarming with eating joints, shacks and clubs serving cocktails, beer and seafood. The Calangute Beach is also known for its water sports activities like parasailing, water surfing, banana ride and jet-skiing.
                
                While the days here are filled with beach fun, nights call for upbeat parties and letting your hair down. Calangute is also popular for staying in Goa as it keeps you well-connected to the other beaches in the north such as Baga, Anjuna, Candolim, Aguada and many more.</span>

        <div class="box" data-aos="zoom-in">
            <img src="image/dudhsagar-falls.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Dudhsagar waterfalls</h3>
            <span class="desc">Aquatic adventures go beyond the beach in Goa. The state is also home to Dudhsagar Falls, a spectacular four-tiered waterfall that towers some 310 meters above the earth. It's one of India's tallest waterfalls and a perpetually popular attraction for day trips around Goa and Karnataka.

                To reach the falls, you'll need to make your way to the village of Colem by taxi or train. Depending on which train route you take, you may get a glimpse of Dudhsagar Falls along the way. Then, you'll hop aboard a shared jeep through the jungle, passing Devil's Canyon along the way. Around 45 minutes later, you'll scurry over some boulders to finally reach the falls.
                
                The best time to visit Dudhsagar Falls is right after the monsoon, when the water is gushing. Tourists who wish to take a dip can rent a life jacket from vendors at the attraction.
                
                Hot tip: Only 300 jeeps are allowed to enter Dudhsagar Falls every day, although tour operators have been requesting to increase the capacity during high season. Make reservations in advance, or prepare to wait in long lines if you wish to visit.</span>

            <img src="image/anjuna-market.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Arjuna Market</h3>
            <span class="desc">Goa is home to a ton of markets, but none offer the liveliness or selection of products found at Anjuna Market. For roughly 50 years, hundreds of vendors have been setting up shop on Anjuna Beach every Wednesday to tempt free-spirited travelers with hippy-inspired trinkets and souvenirs.

                Ornate textiles, woven bikinis, sculptures of deities, dreamcatchers, hammocks, magnets, t-shirts with sassy slogans, beaded jewelry, toys – you name it, you can probably buy it here.
                
                But even if you don't want to shop, you should still make a point to visit Anjuna Market for the sightseeing. The flea market is a swirling array of colorful wares, salespeople driving hard bargains, big bags of fresh spices, and street food galore. The vibe alone is one of the reasons why Anjuna Market is one of the top places to visit in Goa.
                
                Address: 10 St. Michael's Vaddo South, Anjuna, Goa</span>

        <div class="box" data-aos="zoom-in">
            <img src="image/mangeshi-temple.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Mangeshi Temple</h3>
            <span class="desc">Goa's unique culture and heritage are on full display at Mangeshi Temple, a beautiful spiritual attraction that's been standing for roughly 450 years. The pastel blue, gold, and white temple features a seven-story tower that pays homage to one of the Hindu god Shiva's many incarnations: Manguesh. The temple structures surround a sacred pool of water, which is thought to be the most historic part of this religious site.

                You can watch devotees perform pujas (worship rituals) at the temple every day. If you happen to be there on a Monday, you can watch the Manguesh idol taken out for a procession, complete with music, in the late afternoon or early evening.
                
                Address: Dinanath Mangeshkar Road, Mangeshi Village, Mardol, Goa

            <img src="image/fontainhas.jpg" alt="">
            <h3> Fontainhas </h3>
            <span class="desc">Lace up your most comfortable pair of walking shoes and head to Panjim for a stroll around Fontainhas, one of Asia's only Latin quarters. Once the headquarters for the Portuguese government in Goa, the UNESCO-recognized Heritage Zone features colonial houses and cottages decked out with pastel and fluorescent façades. Each of the houses get a fresh coat of paint after the monsoon season every year, ensuring that they always look vibrant for visitors. Don't miss the district's namesake Fountain of Phoenix.

                You can explore the area on your own, or book a walking tour for a more in-depth look at the history of this fascinating neighborhood. Either way, you'll definitely work up an appetite as you wander the narrow cobblestone streets and snap photos in front of the candy-colored buildings. Refuel at one of the decades-old cafés or bakeries in the neighborhood. Confeitaria 31 de Janeiro, a bakery near Mary Immaculate School, is known for having a wide selection of tasty Goan cakes and sweets. </span>
