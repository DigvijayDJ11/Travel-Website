                    Uttar Pradesh. Its capital is the northwestern city of Dehra Dun.On November 9, 2000, the state of
                    Uttaranchal—the 27th state of India—was carved out of Uttar Pradesh, and in January 2007 the new
                    state changed its name to Uttarakhand, meaning “northern region,” which was the traditional name for
                    the area. Area 19,739 square miles (51,125 square km). Pop. (2011) 10,116,752.
                    Uttarakhand can be divided into several physiographic zones, all running parallel to each other from
                    northwest to southeast. The northern zone, popularly known as the Himadri, contains segments of the
                    Zaskar and the Great Himalaya ranges, with elevations ranging roughly from 10,000 to 25,000 feet
                    (3,000 to 7,600 metres). Most of the major peaks are located in this zone. Adjacent to and south of
                    the Great Himalayas is a zone containing the Lesser Himalayas, known popularly as the Himachal, with
                    elevations between about 6,500 and 10,000 feet (2,000 to 3,000 metres); the zone has two linear
                    ranges—the Mussoorie and the Nag Tibba. To the south of the Himachal is a stretch of the Siwalik
                    Range.

                    Located on the Garhwal Himalayan Range in the Rudraprayag District, Kedarnath Temple can only be reached from Gaurikund through a trek and remains open only for six months from April to November, due to heavy snowfall in the region during the rest of the months.
